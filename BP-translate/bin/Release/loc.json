It is said that she lost her memory during this time and served Erinze together with Tiris. Hrelbe was about to head to the research facility to help the kidnapped Erinze. As I accompanied him, Hrelbe told me about Bachelard's plans. It is the \"Abaritia Shell Project\". The idea was to fuse Erinze with a special \"Abaritia Shell\" to control other Abaritia. Of course, there were many opposing opinions, and in the end it was decided that Erinze would release Avalitya. However, even that was Bachelard's speculation. As a result of releasing Abaritia and activating the biometric engram, Erinze was in a state where it was easier to fuse with the Abaritia shell. The fusion of Erinze and Avalitya Shell is still underway. We must reach the research facility as soon as possible and stop the plan."},{"id":85,"text":"◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ We have reached the first floor of the “Kamikake no Onbashira”.

It wasn't to control Abaritia. The real purpose is to destroy the overdeveloped civilization, the \"Beast of the Planet\". Controlling a beast that exists in the imaginary world, not in a fairy tale, was the entirety of the Avalitya Shell Project. In order to protect the planet and civilization, Bachelard tells him that Erinze's sacrifice is unavoidable. However, Tiris does not accept that, and clearly says, \"I want to help Erinze.\" The soldiers sent by Bachelar were taken over by Hrelbe.

The King must have been sick and recuperating. There is no fact that he was assassinated in a dragon attack incident, and of course there is no way Carvain would assassinate him.

Upon hearing this, Erinze guessed that Bachelard had given instructions to the cult in the form of an oracle. In any case, there is no doubt that Tiris and Avalitya Shell are here.
